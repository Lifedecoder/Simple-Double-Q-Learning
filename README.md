# Simple-Double-Q-Learning
Simple implementation of double Q-Learning based on MorvanZhou's RL code

### Double Q-Learning paper:
https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2010/file/091d584fced301b442654dd8c23b3fc9-Paper.pdf
### MovanZhou's code:
https://github.com/MorvanZhou/Reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow/blob/master/contents/1_command_line_reinforcement_learning/treasure_on_right.py

### Details
  ```
  python double_q_learning.py
  ```
  - You can adjust FRESH_TIME and SHOW_TIME to slow down the game process
  - You can uncommon the print line to see how Q-table is iterated
